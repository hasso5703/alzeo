"""A room message says the unit it counts in, and a vLLM lane is named by its official name (v1.46.3).

Every room check of the installers and the switch holds what `df -BG` prints, which is GiB, against a need
counted in GiB, and said both in "GB": "Need ~45 GB free ...; found 44 GB" on a disk with 47.2 GB free, where
the README gives the same check as 49 GB (v1.46.1 gave each size one figure in its unit, and left these
messages; found on 2026-11-10 by the review of that version). They say GiB now. ple-table.py divides bytes by
10^9 and keeps its GB.

The vLLM lanes' installers named their lane in a sentence by a short name (VLANE_SHORT: "Kolibri", "Nemotron",
"Super VL") where every other line of a run says the official one (decision 1180 of 2026-11-07, lane_title),
and check-pins.sh headed their pins "Kolibri lane", "Nemotron lane" and "Nemotron Super lane".
